title: ESP32 Cam Timelapses  - Updated
---

I recently found out about the ESP32 Camera boards and thought they could be useful for small, cheap (~Â£5) and easy to use timelapse cameras.

I created a sketch to do just that (code [here](https://github.com/ToXIc-Dev/Arduino_Stuff/tree/master/ESP32%20Cam/timelapse) in the timelapse_ble folder)

I got some pretty good [results](https://imgur.com/a/4X6JZex).


### Update - 15/2/2020
I have now switched over to using the Timelapse2 sketch in that repository as it's easier to use and has a preview.
