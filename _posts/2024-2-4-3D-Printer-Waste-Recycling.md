title: 3D Printer Waste Recycling
---

Finally a use for all that waste!

I have kept my 3D printing waste since I got a 3D printer back in 2018, I dont print that much but had still amassed a decent sized shopping bag full of it, I've always hoped that someday I could re-use it, I know that trying to melt it back into filament is a whole different headache so I haven't tried that yet.

I have seen before that people have melted it into silicon moulds and I like that idea but I first needed to get my waste into more of a shredded size, I came across [this idea](https://www.instructables.com/Low-Cost-Plastic-Shredder/) of using a handheld planer mounted upside down to make a low cost shredder so I decided to give it a go, here are my results.

First I'll show a picture of the successful moulded skull, Pretty good right!

### Shredder Setup

My shredder setup consists of a cheap £35 Handheld Planer ([Link for people in the UK](https://www.screwfix.com/p/titan-ttb930pln-2mm-electric-planer-240v/593vv)) with a DIY frame and chute mounted around it with a push stick to force parts into the blade, I also 3D printed a 90 Degree dust port pipe.

The reason I didnt design it exactly like the Instructables page is because I thought that design limited the size of parts that could go through it, I tried to fix that in my design, I got someway towards that but I think more can be done.

Note: this frame and chute design is far from perfect as when they push stick isnt in place it throws stuff everywhere, I'll probably refine the design to stop that.

This is what the inside looks like, the slopes are at 30 degree angles.

It shreds stuff pretty well, huge parts dont fit but a lot does or can be broken to fit, here is a video of it.

The shredder output isnt amazing but the pieces arent too big, its good for the price.

### Mould Setup

For melting the shredded bits into a mould I use a [toaster oven](https://i.imgur.com/9jkwUM7.jpg) that I got off FB marketplace for £10.

The parts are put into a mould like so and put onto a tray in the oven, I had the temp set at around 220C and make sure to only use the bottom heating element, having the top one on caused it to burn the filament.

That's basically it, I managed to produce the results seen at the top, I'm really happy with the result, Im probably gonna try other moulds and maybe refine the proccess.
